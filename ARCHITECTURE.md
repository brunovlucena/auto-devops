## üéØ **Architecture Overview**

Auto-DevOps operates in two primary modes:

1. **üñ•Ô∏è Local Mode**: Developers run Jamie and Scarlet locally for development and testing
2. **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Mode**: Managed service using Kamaji to provision private clusters for customers

## üñ•Ô∏è **Local Development Mode**

### **Architecture Principles**
- **Self-Contained**: Everything runs on developer's machine
- **Fast Iteration**: Instant deployment and testing
- **Resource Efficient**: Optimized for laptop hardware
- **Cloud Compatible**: Same APIs and interfaces as cloud mode

### **Components**
```yaml
Local Stack:
  Cluster: Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)
  Agents:
    - Jamie (Local LLM - Llama 3.1 8B)
    - Scarlet (Lightweight automation)
  Observability:
    - Prometheus (minimal config)
    - Grafana (essential dashboards)
    - Loki (local logs)
  Storage:
    - Local SQLite for agent memory
    - Local file system for models
    - Git for configuration sync
```

### **Hardware Requirements**
```yaml
Minimum:
  CPU: 8 cores (M2 Pro / Ryzen 7)
  RAM: 32GB
  Storage: 500GB SSD
  Network: Broadband internet

Recommended:
  CPU: 12+ cores (M3 Max / Ryzen 9)
  RAM: 64GB
  Storage: 1TB+ SSD
  GPU: Optional (for model training)
```

### **Local Development Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Initialize local environment
./scripts/local-setup.sh

# 2. Start local cluster with agents
make local-up

# 3. Develop and test
make test-local

# 4. Deploy changes to local cluster
make deploy-local

# 5. Push to cloud when ready
make cloud-deploy
```

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Deployment Mode**

### **Architecture Principles**
- **Multi-Tenant**: Isolated private clusters per customer
- **Scalable**: Horizontal scaling across regions
- **Secure**: Network isolation and RBAC
- **Managed**: Automated provisioning and maintenance

### **Kamaji Integration**
```yaml
Kamaji Role:
  - Provision customer Kubernetes clusters
  - Manage cluster lifecycle (create, update, delete)
  - Handle networking and security policies
  - Provide cluster access credentials
  - Monitor cluster health and capacity

Customer Cluster Features:
  - Dedicated control plane
  - Isolated networking (VPC/VNET)
  - Customer-specific RBAC
  - Private registry access
  - Backup and disaster recovery
```

### **Cloud Components**
```yaml
Management Plane:
  - Kamaji Controller (cluster provisioning)
  - Agent Manager (Jamie/Scarlet deployment)
  - Multi-Tenant Manager (customer isolation)
  - Shared Services (models, knowledge base)

Customer Plane:
  - Private Kubernetes cluster (via Kamaji)
  - Jamie agent (customer-specific context)
  - Scarlet agent (customer-specific policies)
  - Observability stack (customer data)
  - Customer workloads
```

## üîÑ **Unified Agent Architecture**

### **Jamie Agent (DevOps Co-Pilot)**
```yaml
Local Mode:
  Model: Llama 3.1 8B (local Ollama)
  Memory: Local SQLite database
  Context: Single developer/team
  Integrations: Local tools and services

Cloud Mode:
  Model: Shared large model with customer context
  Memory: Customer-isolated database
  Context: Customer-specific environment
  Integrations: Customer's tools and services
```

### **Scarlet Agent (Automation Engine)**
```yaml
Local Mode:
  Scope: Local cluster only
  Actions: Development-safe operations
  Learning: Local patterns and preferences
  Autonomy: High (safe local environment)

Cloud Mode:
  Scope: Customer's entire infrastructure
  Actions: Production-grade operations
  Learning: Customer-specific patterns
  Autonomy: Configurable per customer policy
```

### **Shared Agent Features**
```yaml
Common Capabilities:
  - Natural language interface
  - Kubernetes operations
  - Observability integration
  - GitOps workflows
  - Incident response
  - Performance optimization

Mode-Specific Adaptations:
  - Resource constraints (local vs cloud)
  - Security policies (dev vs production)
  - Integration scope (local vs customer)
  - Learning boundaries (personal vs tenant)
```

## üîê **Security & Isolation**

### **Local Security**
```yaml
Threat Model:
  - Local development environment
  - Single user/team access
  - Network isolation not critical
  - Focus on preventing accidents

Security Measures:
  - Local authentication only
  - Resource limits on agents
  - Safe default configurations
  - Easy reset/recovery options
```

### **Cloud Security**
```yaml
Threat Model:
  - Multi-tenant cloud environment
  - Customer data isolation
  - Network-level security required
  - Compliance requirements (SOC2, etc.)

Security Measures:
  - Customer cluster isolation via Kamaji
  - Network policies and encryption
  - RBAC and service accounts
  - Audit logging and monitoring
  - Secret management (Vault integration)
  - Zero-trust networking
```
